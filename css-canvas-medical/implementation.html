            <p>
            You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
              determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
              unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much
              information as possible to make this determination one way or the
              other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application
              for you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current
              customers to talk about their experience.

            <p class="roi-list-title"><span class="tiempos-headline">2.</span> Interfaces and Community Integration</p>
            <p>
              Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
              community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax
              number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting
              bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred specialists
              and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing loops
              is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or
              other information technology vendors are important, we will work with you to
              determine what we can deliver and when.
            </p>
            <p class="roi-list-title"><span class="tiempos-headline">3.</span> Data Migration</p>
            <p>
              The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data,
              which we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR
              databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. patient demographics and
              information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
              While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has been
              able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
            </p>
            <p class="roi-list-title"><span class="tiempos-headline">4.</span> Training and Site Visit</p>
            <p>
              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
              charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks prior
              to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice management,
              and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit your
              practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and training.
            </p>
            <p class="roi-list-title"><span class="tiempos-headline">5.</span> Go-Live and Tuning</p>
            <p>
              Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be
              with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
              everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a handful
              of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up
              new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.

            <p class="roi-list-title"><span class="tiempos-headline">6.</span> Sustained Performance</p>
            <p>
              All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide support over
              the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can terminate
              the agreement and receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans,
              we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for
              everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive partnership
              for us both.
